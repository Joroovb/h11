I/O free state machine implementation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Inspired by the amazing work of [python-hyper](https://github.com/python-hyper/h11).

‚ö†Ô∏è I'm currently renovating an old house which does not allow me to work on [requestz](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/requestz/), [h11](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/h11/) and [http](https://github.com/ducdetronquito/http) as much as I would like to. Further development will likely to start again around december 2022. In the meantime, feel free to fork :)
